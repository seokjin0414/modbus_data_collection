# High-Performance Parallel IoT Sensor Data Collection Client/Server Example with Axum

This project demonstrates a high-performance, parallel IoT sensor data collection client-server system built with **Rust** using the [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) web framework.

The current implementation includes data collection from **GEMS_3005** sensors using Modbus communication.  
Planned features include support for additional protocols such as raw socket communication and **SIHAS**.

## Features

- **Role:**  
  Each collection point acts as both a sensor data collector and a server, collecting data from network-connected sensors and forwarding the collected data to a central server or service via **REST API** or **gRPC**.
- Sensor **memory map information** and **collection point configuration** are cached locally (L1 cache) at server startup to significantly improve data collection speed.
  - *(Note: "L1 cache" typically refers to CPU cache, but here it means an application-level local memory cache.)*
- All connections to sensors and data collection processes are fully **asynchronous and parallelized**, ensuring optimal collection speed regardless of the number of sensors.
- The implemented **GEMS_3005** sensor example collects data from 18 different addresses (addr) at each collection point in parallel, with optimized logic for this use case.
- **Highly accurate periodic scheduling is possible via a custom-built task scheduler**.  
  The scheduler calculates the next precise run time and aligns execution using Rustâ€™s async timer primitives (`interval_at`), which minimizes time drift and scheduling errors even over long runtimes.
